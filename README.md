# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

## First Jupyter File (Linear Regression):
In this file, I wrote code that predicts which city in our dataset yields the highest profit.  
The dataset contains data from various cities along with their corresponding profits. Our main goal is to predict the true profit value based on a city's population.  
I implemented gradient descent to find the optimal values of **w** and **b** that minimize the error.
